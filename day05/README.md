# Day 05: Creating a Makefile for a Two-Tier Application

In this session, we will be creating a `Makefile` to automate the build and deployment processes for a two-tier application. The `Makefile` will streamline repetitive tasks, such as compiling code and deploying the application, ensuring consistency and efficiency throughout the development and deployment lifecycle.

## Objectives:
- Understand the structure of a `Makefile`.
- Automate key tasks for the two-tier application using `make` commands.
- Improve development and deployment workflows with automation.

## GitHub Repository
The resources, including the code and detailed instructions for this exercise, are available in the GitHub repository linked below:

[[GitHub Repository Link](https://github.com/LondheShubham153/two-tier-flask-app.git)](#)

## Tasks:
1. Review the existing two-tier application code in the repository.
2. Write a `Makefile` to automate the following tasks:
   - Build the application.
   - Deploy the application to the appropriate environment.
3. Test the `Makefile` to ensure that all tasks execute correctly.
4. Submit your `Makefile` and any relevant documentation.

## Prerequisites:
- Familiarity with basic `Makefile` syntax.
- Access to the GitHub repository with the code for the two-tier application.
- A working development environment for compiling and deploying the application.

Let's get started!
